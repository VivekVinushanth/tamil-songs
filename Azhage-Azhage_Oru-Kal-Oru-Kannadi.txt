Song  : Adada Oru Devathai
Movie : Azhage Azhage
Author: Na. Muthukumar 

You beauty! You are the most beautiful! I lost myself gracefully around you.
Five minutes is all it took, for my heart to ignite with desire!
My dreams were varied and weird. While I came to surrender myself to you, at the
same speed, my doubts held me back.
Are you the fish that swallows the fisherman or the deer which defeats the hunter?
Am I the dear lover of yours?

Come, my dear, with the delicacy of three fruits!
You're the mist in the midst of fire! Without your glance, I feel alone.
Come, my dear, with the delicacy of three fruits!
You're the mist in the midst of fire! My time will go on for you.

When your fierce glare hurt me like fire, your next glance soothed me gently. 
Both your eyes will convey a love, but you will give me a slip.
You will often prick me like a thorn. But you will blossom like a flower!
Will you take pity on me and open the gates of your heart for me?
This love is like an infant; it cries for more attention.
I plead you. I ask to take me in your arms. 
You refuse to hear. You continue to feign. Between us love strolls around.

I have several dreams, but should I reveal them to you? Are you a friend with whom
I can have an open conversation?
You liked me at first sight. Is it like wise for me?
Why do you hunt for a trout in an oasis?

You are the temple chariot. I am a lone tree branch. When you cross me, you break my
heart. 

Are you a relentless persuer? Are you parading in your day dreams? Why are you
after me? Why are you getting to me? Between us is there any love?

PS: Mukkani - meaning Three fruits in Tamil. Namely mango, jackfruit and banana.
