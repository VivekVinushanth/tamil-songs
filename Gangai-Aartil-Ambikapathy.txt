A colorful bird took a dip into the waters of Ganges. By the time it reached the
bank, it emerged out as a wonderful goddess.

A colorful bird took a dip into the waters of Ganges and emerged out as a shining
goddess.

Look out for her and ask her if she is Amaravati? I am Ambikapathy. I wonder who
my Amaravati is.

The heart that beats every moment for me, says its all for you.
The hearts that yearned only for themselves, are now pining for the two of us.

When I came across your overpowering beauty, it forced my proud poet's hat to
give way to a dunce's.

When you come by the streets of Kasi, my dear, I beg for your fleeting glance.

Look out for her and ask her if she is Amaravati?

Through several pitfalls my heart has treaded carefully, but falls cluelessly
at your sight.

Why do you need a knife to put together a garland, when a needle will suffice?

When I keep thinking about you, tears flood my eyes and my body feels weak.
My heart races in your quest and leaves me woefully short of breath.

We came to the earth destined to find our better halves. I am the half you
are searching for, my lady, reach for me.

Look out for her and ask her if she is Amaravati?
