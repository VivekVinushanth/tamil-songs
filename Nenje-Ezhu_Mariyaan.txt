Even if a thousand suns burn the skin.
Even if the resolve of kindness dissolves.
Even if evil rules all the skies.
Even if humanity forgets love.
Even if the heart is numbed with pain.
Your love will not die.

Soar, my heart. Rise, my heart!
Soar, my heart. Rise, my heart!
Love never dies!

Even if memories escape your mind.
Even if all the seasons change.
Even if a child forgets laughter.
Even if laws of nature no longer hold.
Your love will not die.

Soar, my heart. Rise, my heart!
Soar, my heart. Rise, my heart!
Love never dies!

Fear not! Despair not!
There are no more worries.
This is a new life.
Your road is littered with flowers!
Everyday your love will fullfill its promise.
Do not lose yourself. Do not disappear into the oblivion.

Soar, my heart. Rise, my heart!
Soar, my heart. Rise, my heart!
Love never dies!

Even if a thousand suns burn the skin.
Even if the resolve of kindness dissolves.
Even if the heart is numbed with pain.
Your love will not die.

Soar, my heart. Rise, my heart!
Soar, my heart. Rise, my heart!
Love never dies!
