Song  : Netru Aval Irundhal
Movie : Mariyaan
Author: Vaali

Yesterday, she was here. I was with her too.
Hey Mariyaan. Come here!
Yesterday, she was here. I was with her too.
I was there!
Yesterday, she was here. I was with her too.

In a sky, light by a hundred moons,
Blue pigeons were flying around.
The air was filled with her sweet voice.
Her flower like body blossomed through the sand.

In a sky, light by a hundred moons,
Blue pigeons were flying around.
The air was filled with her sweet voice.
Her flower like body blossomed through the sand.

Yesterday, the only air that I breathed was nothing but your love.
Yesterday, the only air that I breathed was nothing but your love.
Yesterday, in my book there was no word called "despair".
Yesterday, the only sound from my bangles were your tunes.
Dear, bring back all the yesterdays today.

Yesterday, you were here. I was there with you.
Yes. You were here. We were here!
Yesterday, you were here. I was there with you.

In a sky, light by a hundred moons,
Blue pigeons were flying around.
The waves were asking for your whereabouts.
The shore was yearning for the long departed wave.
