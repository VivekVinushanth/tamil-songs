Song  : Sathiyama
Movie : Ethir Neechal
Author: Dhanush

I swear, I do not need you.
I drank for ten days, but never got high.
My world has ended, my trousers have become tattered.
Now I have nothing to lose.

Conch will signal the end.
You have crack in a pocket.
What's more than your life?
Do not get tensed.
The earth is below. The sun is on the sky.
Just live the moment, do not cry.

Hey, why did you come here?
Hey, did you kill me woman?

I built a castle out of bamboo.
I am the king, You are my queen.
I worked day and night, and spent it all on you.
Is it all in vain, am I mad?
There is nothing inside me,
But you, I swear. My queen.

The wind displaces cotton.
A love lorn heart breaks down.
A girl's heart is poisonous.
How many rounds so far? Five.
I sing this song on a high.
You can quickly feel the sadness.
Why is there lust in your eyes?
That thirst ends too quickly.
