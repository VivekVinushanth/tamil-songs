Like an eyelid, I am keeping a watch over you all day.
Is there any wound that does not heal? Let's face it all.

Why my buddy! Why does sadness linger in your eyes? Even if the clouds roll 
against you, cross the chasm, buddy.

Time can take you through endless paths; you may be bruised severely.
Till the stream runs through its course, do not stop swimming.

Why my buddy! Let this pass. Today is not the end of it all. Keep going, my buddy.
