With a flower around the horn,
A dot on the forehead.
A bull raised by the hand of a maiden?
Or a cow, that can be milked on touch?
If it hits you, tie that tail. Lock it to the plough.
Hey Moped girl, show me your face now.
Go to Sembatti Market for a good price.
Oh my god, Annalakshmi lost the wager.

Take the Kovilpatti drum. Join the crowd and clap your hands.
In Kottayur you pay your due to the Sandiyar.

How many scars, come and count them?
My chest carries the scars of bravery.
It's not just one or two.
All the bulls that dared are now invalid. Who cares?
Shall I remove the belt around my hip?
Shall I display the open wound?

Hope you now understood my strength.
Your bull just tickled my back.
I am not a bull that wags a tail at the sight of a female.
I am jobless, take a look.

Before the days run out,
If a maiden does not have a match,
What else should we tell?
Look for a suitable boy, buddy.
And shepherd that bull around.
At the east end of the village,
Set up a shop, my lady.
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

Let us join you for grinding Idli flour.
Let us gather a crowd in a short notice.
Good times have arrived,
If you miss the moment do not lay the blame on us.
