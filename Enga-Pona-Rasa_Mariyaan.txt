Song  : Enga Pona Rasa
Movie : Mariyaan
Author: Kutti Revathi

Where did you go, my dear?
It is dusk already.
The stew has gone cold.
Come into my heart.

If we unite, the sky will celebrate.
The sky will celebrate.
If you and I become one, we will live the boon of our life.
Where did you go, my dear?
I am so mad about you.

The time freezes inside me.
My tears drain into the sea.
I long for your face; your body.
Where did you go, my dear?
What am I to do dear?
Where did you go, my dear?
What am I to do dear?
My youth is getting wasted.
