Oh,connoisseur of art!

Across the earth and the horizon, all you see is only your woman.
You can not keep from laying your hands on any thing you survey.

Oh,connoisseur of art!

You man of many a feat, you are a conman who steals a saree in exchange for a
hand kerchief.
You are the wretched one, who seeks salvation at Kaasi through your misdeamours.

No one made a living out of lie. Never did truth fail anybody.

Hey you, who can tread ropes out of thin air - you are a lovable man.
You notorious, lovabale connoisseur of Kaasi. 
Don't you come here and take a look?

Like a Krishnan, who captures the heart of young woman, you are expert on tricks
of the trade.
How do you hoodwink all the women, share the truth with me?

Your heart's greed knows no bounds, when it wants the mighty Ganges in the 
palm of your hands.
You want to hide the shining lighting, in the pockets of your Pajama.

While the victorious owns the land, you lazy beetle chewer own Kaasi!
For you can open locks with, a wink of your eye.

You are a lovable man - you notorious, lovabale connoisseur of Kaasi.
