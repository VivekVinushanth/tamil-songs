When there is a pain in your eyes, dreams do not appear. 

I searched through the fragrant breeze, looking for your breath.
Into the sea, now fell a drop, I searched through it too.

Before the blood of my life evaporates, my eyes will find you, my dear!
Before my life departs, reach for me quickly.

Can you hear my frequency in the air?
On listening to the song, can you feel the tears of a lonely soul?
Isn't your heart getting drenched?
Can't you smell the angst of a burning heart?

Adding my tears to the humid air, pouring into it melliflous hymns,
I reached for your place.
Before my fleeting life departs, reach for me, my dear!

When there is a pain in your eyes, dreams do not appear. 

Time is filled with your reflections. But my hands can not reach out for them.
The air is full of your fragrance. But that scent isn't life.
Plucking my life from its root, pushing me into a glowing blaze,
Where did you disappear bewitching me?
Before my fleeting life departs, reach for me, my dear!
