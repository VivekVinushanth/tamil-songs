All the black drangos along the forest path.
There is a passerby waiting, do you know her heart?

My heart is beating to chirps. My life is losing its bearing.
A green cuckoo flew by, and my heart is teetering unsteadily.

Two Hundred years for her eyes,
Three Hunderd years for her shapely nose,
I should live five hundred years in the warmth of her beauty.

You made me freeze with a glance.
You made me melt with a small smile.
You destroyed my ego and tamed me with your glance.
You captured my six foot frame, you made me surrender at your feet.

As the water droplets condense before they hits the earth,
The strange man has vanished in a moment.

Your glance brings me salvation.
Your are the beginning as well as the end.
Your are the beginning as well as the end.

Are you the ruby I sighted in the rain?
Do you reign supreme in my heart?
Will this go on for a day or two?
Or will it affect the bottom of my heart?

A rainbow does not appear twice. It leaves without a trace.
On a train on the rail, a cuckoo that flew by, but its voice remains with you.
My heart gained partly from by.
My heart lost partly to you.

The light of love, the rule of my life. Are you goddess? Is that true or false?
