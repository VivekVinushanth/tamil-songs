Song  : Dil Se Re
Movie : Dil Se
Author: Gulzar

Two flowers on a branch, a strom over the mountain, the heart trembles with dread.
You chanced upon my life. My honey!

The tears, the tears of joy. 
My frantic search left me drained, but I chanced to see you again.
Oh my woman, do not you talk to me?
Oh my dear, do not you look my way?

Isn't your glance insincere? Aren't you but a mask?
Isn't a woman's heart a jail? Correct, isn't it?

In a woman's heart there is lust; there is want of youth; there is a burning desire. 
Why do you mask all of these today? Woman, you puzzle me.
I do not know the answer. Tell me.

An immovable stone does not prevent grass blades from finding the root.
Like that our love will endure. I see joy in your eyes!

Oh frothy river, where are you? Did you disappear en route?
Did you cross many an obstacle? Tell me my dear.
Oh dear, your memories are a dream that engulfs my eye.
This is a relationship that robs my heart.
Your kiss is one that's welcome.
Hey queen of strange lands, stop there. Whisper a silent word!

Between us there is a bond, like the one between soil and rain.
Even if it top dries, the bottom remains moist.
Oh my dear, dear, dear!
