Song  : Kaadhal Konjam
Movie : Pachaikili Muththucharam
Author: Thamarai 

With a little love, and a little breeze for company in our journey,
no distance is too distant.
And the sky will greet us with a gentle shower.

I will lift you up softly and reach out to the horizon.
Amdist the twilight, in the dawn of your lives, I await the the golden rays of
the morning.

Will the future knock me over or will it embrace me with a helping hand?
Will it help me overcome my remaining fears or will it end up dousing my courage?
An unknown fragrance will permeate our space and in its sweetness our life's
struggles will wade away.

I will tightly clasp the string of pearls in the warmth of my palm, forever.
Even if a lovely parrot struts before me, my sanctuary will deny it an entry.

Though the waning moon lights our path, my dreams will never fade, as we walk
shoulder to shoulder and go the distance.
