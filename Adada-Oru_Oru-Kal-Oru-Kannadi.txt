Song  : Adada Oru Devathai
Movie : Oru Kal Oru Kannadi
Author: Na. Muthukumar 

Woh! A goddess is crisscrossing my path. Who wove this beauty in fresh silk?
A huge wave is crashing against my eyes. Is this pain or pleasure? What will
ensue? Who is she?

Oh my heart!

Oh my heart, you made me soar to unknown heights. You made me forgetful of my
kin and kith.
Oh my heart, you made me reborn. You leave me delirious at the same time.

Who is she, a daughter of Indira? Or a replica of the moon on the earth, who
substitutes in the morning? Is her wavy hair a forest which smells like sandal
wood? Is her glance, an act of providence? Who in the world is she?

She came as the fire. She made me flutter!
She came as the wind. She filled my bearth!

Oh my heart, you made me soar to unknown heights. You made me forgetful of my
kin and kith.
Oh my heart, you made me reborn. You leave me delirious at the same time.
