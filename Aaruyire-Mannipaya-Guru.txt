Song  : Tere Bina

Author: Gulzar

My sweet heart, will you forgive me? Please tell me, my dear.
The nights that pass without you, smother me with your absence.  

But if you keep away from me, my moon will wane into a decline; my blue sky will
fade to a pale.
In your fire like wrath, I languished losing my mind; I wilted like a plant, dying
without seeing the sun's ray, losing myself in your thoughts.

Without you, how will the song and music sound sweet to me?  Do you not realise
that your beauty enslaves my five senses? Oh dear, will you forgive me?

Is it just if the thron hurts a rose flower? Do you think if your repeated 
appeals, will end my displeasure?

To be impoverished is bliss; to have, but still be denied is pain. Do not kill me
by your non-violent ways.

My dear, should I forgive you? Please tell me.
The nights that pass without you, smother me with your absence.
