My love. It's all for you. The Monalisa's shine on you!

You lighten up the sky like a lightning. What am I to do about that?
You poured oil into my cup of imagination.
How did you change the color of the white sky, by the sleight of hand?

You lighten up the sky like a lightning. What am I to do about that?
You pull out strings from my rainbow,
And why do you try to weave that to your heart?

Oh Oh Priya Priya
Are you the beat of my heart?
My senses longed for this.
Are you the answer to that penance?

I lived in a world without flowers, till I met you.
Now I am incarcerated in a flower.
I said there was no woman in my life.
Now your fragrance trickles down to my insides.
This love is now suffocating me.

I was barren like a desert.
You flowed like a river of love and
Made my life an oasis.
If my heart is water, are you a fish that takes to it?
If my love is a forest, are you a grazing deer?
Are you the one who rests in the warmth of my shyness?
