Lie, is thy name woman?
Is her love like superficial like an eye liner?

A woman's love is like a dew drop resting on a blade of grass. No sooner the sun
appears, than the dew disappears into thin air.
Love, it comes first. Tears follow.

Words can not sum up it. My heart is a wavering kite that unsteadily struts 
towards you.

Is this what you desired for, my heart tries to reason with me. "Should I go
on for this woman?", it chides me.

My pleading heart tells my foolish head, that this girl leaves you no better
than dead. It finally realizes how she hurts me like a fire. Love is a lethal
weapon in the hands of this woman.

Lie, is thy name woman?
Is her love like superficial like an eye liner?
